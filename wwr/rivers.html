                    of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never

                <p>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed
                    rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the
                    early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all
                    summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower,
                    warmer water more.

                    flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert

                <p>CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are
                    technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.
                    However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to
                    both.
