      Main idea – Home page
      Hello, my name is Oscar Rodriguez and I am passionate about web development and digital design. I have extensive
      experience developing web systems with PHP and MYSQL. I use Bootstrap as a framework for the presentation of the
      pages and functionalities of the systems. I consider the most important quality in customer service since the
      customer is the most important thing in the process of developing web applications.
      Small functions such as mathematical operations, and database updates to combined queries are my specialty.
      I am always open to changes and improvements within the scope established in the project. I like the client to be
      completely satisfied with my work.

    <h3>Web Development</h3>
    <p>
      Web development – Page 2
      Do you have an idea for your business? I can help define your project through concrete ideas that will help your
      business.
      Don't know if you should migrate to a new system? The fear of change is always there, however, safely venturing to
      new platforms will help you in your work process.
      I have had the opportunity to develop systems that help optimize time and improve processes within a company.
      Another important aspect is security, and the developments that I have made comply with this very important aspect
      for the management of company information.

    <h3>Digital Design</h3>
    <p>
      Digital Design – Page 2
      One of the ways your business can be boosted is your image, so through a review process we can together determine
      what is best for your business.
      In the digital design part, I use Photoshop and Illustrator to design marketing through social networks for a
      positive impact on clients for companies. Using the basic principles for design, I have been able to make
      compositions that carry the message that the client wants from the target audience.
